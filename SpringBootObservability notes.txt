I followed this tutorial:
    Spring Boot Observability Uncovered: Enabling & Using the Observation API
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exRkiVLyPpc

    The #1 Spring Boot Starter you should include in every single application
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OVe0MWgZ4k

How to start the application ?
    1. Make sure Docker is running
    2. Run main from Application class
    3. go to http://localhost:8080/ and see Hello World
    4. and http://localhost:8080/api/posts ...where you will need to login with "dan" and "password" (see SecurityConfig)
    to see 100 posts retrieved from an online service...

We added spring-boot-starter-actuator for Observability of various endpoints/ app metrics etc
Docker compose file compose.yaml is used to start a Zipkin container, which is a webapp where one can see various logs created
by the app.

In application.properties file there is a setting "management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*" ...here you can specify only a
subset of the exposed information...As you can see this is now configured to explose all...but you can expose only health and beans
for example like this : "management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,beans"
This "management.endpoint.health.show-details=always" shows the health information all the time. In production one would want some of these
endpoints to require logins.

If you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator you can see all kinds of URL exposed by the actuator dependency of the app.
If you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/health you can see the status of the application...and which app is running
Next if you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/info you will see info about the app
Next if you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans you can see all beans in the app.
Next if you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/ you can see all the metrics collected by the app.
Next if you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests you can further see details about the metrics
collected during https requests.
or if you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/spring.security.authentications you see how many users are authenticated

if you visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/randomEndpoint you will a custom endpoint RandomEndpoint

If you visit http://localhost:9411/zipkin/ you can see the dashboard of the zipkin webapp.
If you press the button "RUN QUERY" you can see a list of all the requests made.
